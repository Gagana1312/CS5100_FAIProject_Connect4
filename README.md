# Connect 4: Advanced AI Algorithms

## Project Overview
This project is part of the CS5100: Foundations of Artificial Intelligence course at Northeastern University. Our team has developed an AI agent capable of playing the Connect 4 game across various difficulty levels—from easy to unbeatable—using advanced AI algorithms.

## Algorithms Implemented
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Enhances the Minimax algorithm by ignoring branches that won't affect the final decision, improving efficiency.
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**: Uses randomness to simulate game outcomes, providing insights for strategic decision-making at higher difficulties.
- **Expectimax**: Offers a probabilistic approach, ideal for handling less predictable opponent strategies.
- **Minimax**: A classic approach that evaluates possible moves by assuming both players choose optimally.

## Getting Started
To run the Connect 4 game, you will need Python installed on your system. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory containing the game files.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher

### Installation
